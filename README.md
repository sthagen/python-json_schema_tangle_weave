# python-json_schema_tangle_weave
Prototyping a usable workflow for documenting a json schema as an international standard via tangle and weave.

## Early ideas only
Basic flow is to filter the .json schema via weave into a .json.md mixing in existing prose sandwich.

Create .json schema again via tangle from .json.md sandwich.

Note: The default branch (with special meaning for github and gitlab users) has the name default ðŸ˜‰
